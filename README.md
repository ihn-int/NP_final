## Usage

### Environment

> This project is mainly developed on WSL2. Thus, the following simply illustrate how to deploy the project on WSL2.

1. Install SFML library.
   `sudo apt-get install -y libsfml-dev`
2. Install OpenGL dependency. (Not necessary)
3. Install X server on WSL2 and export the DISPLAY variable.
   I use mobaXterm to connect the WSL since it provide X server.
4. Build the project in 'code' directory by typing 'make'.
